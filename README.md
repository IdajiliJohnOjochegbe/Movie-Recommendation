# Introduction
This project implements a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating). This project leverages user ratings to provide personalized movie suggestions.

# Features
Personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.

Implementation of collaborative filtering techniques.

Easy-to-use interface for getting recommendations.

Visualization of user-item interaction matrix.

# Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender

**Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
python -m venv env

source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

# To use the movie recommender, follow these steps:

**Prepare the dataset** : Ensure you have a dataset of user ratings for movies. You can use popular datasets like the MovieLens dataset.

# Run the recommender system:

python recommender.py

Get recommendations: The script will prompt you to enter user details or use a predefined user ID to generate recommendations.

# Data

The recommender system relies on a dataset of user ratings. we used the MovieLens dataset, which provides a rich collection of user ratings for movies.

# Methodology

This project uses collaborative filtering, which can be divided into two main approaches:

User-based Collaborative Filtering: This method recommends items based on the similarity between users.

Item-based Collaborative Filtering: This method recommends items based on the similarity between items.

The system computes similarity scores and uses these scores to predict ratings for items that the user hasn't rated yet, thereby generating recommendations.

# Results

The recommender system has been tested with the MovieLens dataset, showing promising results in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are included in the project.
